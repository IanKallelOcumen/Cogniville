# Firebase

- **google-services.json** — Your Firebase config file (already placed here). Used by the official Firebase Unity SDK if you import it.
- The project also supports **REST-only** Firebase (no SDK) via `FirebaseConfig` asset; see `Assets/Scripts/Backend/README_FIREBASE_SPARK.md`.

To import the Firebase Unity SDK packages: **Tools > Cogniville > Import Firebase SDK packages** (requires `FirebaseSDK/` unzipped in the project root).
